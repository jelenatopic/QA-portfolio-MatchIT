MatchIT stands out as a revolutionary platform designed to simplify the job search process in the IT sector, often referred to as the "Tinder for employment." This innovative mobile application has recently debuted in Serbia, offering a unique approach to connecting job seekers with opportunities. In a style reminiscent of the popular dating app, users can effortlessly swipe through various job listings, indicating their interest. Upon a successful match, the user is seamlessly connected with potential employers through MatChat, the platform's messaging feature, facilitating direct communication and streamlining the hiring process.

<b> This repository serves as a showcase of my contributions to the application. </b> The portfolio within contains key documents, including improvements, bug reports, and test cases, offering a comprehensive view of my involvement in the project.
